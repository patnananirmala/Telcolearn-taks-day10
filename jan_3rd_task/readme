##Question 1
Running Two Static Websites on Different Ports
Scenario
Two static websites are provided: one student portal and one faculty portal. Both must run simultaneously using Docker containers.
Tasks
1. Build two separate images or reuse one image twice.
2. Run both containers in parallel on different host ports.
3. Access both websites in browser.
4. Verify that no port conflict occurs.
##Question 2
Liveness and Readiness Probes
YAML Manifest:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: probe-demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: probe-demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: probe-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: probe-container
        image: nginx
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 2
Tasks:
• Deploy YAML
• Describe pod conditions
• Break nginx content
• Observe probe failure
